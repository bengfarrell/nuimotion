NUIMotion
====================

"NuiMotion" AddOn for Node.js

This AddOn serves as a wrapper for OpenNI and NITE.  OpenNI is an open source solution for working with depth cameras like the Microsoft Kinect or Asus Xtion Pro.  Meanwhile, NITE is the middleware for working with these devices.  It acts like the brain to capture skeletal, hand, gesture, etc data pulled from the depth information that OpenNI provides.

You can find the OpenNI foundation at www.openni.org
